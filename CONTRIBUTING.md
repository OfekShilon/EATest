### Pull Request Policy

All code contributions to EASTL are submitted as [Github pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).  All pull requests will be reviewed by an EASTL maintainer according to the guidelines found in the next section.

Your pull request should:

* merge cleanly
* come with tests
	* tests should be minimal and stable
	* fail before your fix is applied
* pass the test suite
* code formatting is encoded in clang format
	* limit using clang format on new code
	* do not deviate from style already established in the files
